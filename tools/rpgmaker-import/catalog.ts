// tools/rpgmaker-import/catalog.ts — every RPG Maker MV/MZ event command
// code, Conditional Branch subtype and move-route code, with what the kit
// would need to map the ones the importer cannot carry natively.
//
// `continuation` marks codes that never stand alone: the extra lines of a
// multi-line command (401 text, 405 scrolling text, 408 comment, 505 route
// display copy, 605 shop goods, 655 script, 657 MZ plugin arguments) and the
// branch markers of block commands (402/403/404 choices, 411/412 branch,
// 413 loop, 601..604 battle). Coverage counts the head command only.
//
// `sampleCommands(code)` builds a minimal, plausible list exercising one
// code (with its continuation lines and branch markers, indent 0 base). The
// tests feed every code through the converter with it, and the coverage
// report uses it to show each code's static disposition.
