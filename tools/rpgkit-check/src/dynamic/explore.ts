// tools/rpgkit-check/src/dynamic/explore.ts — headless exploration coverage.
//
// Drives the real engine from the project start with a deterministic
// "explore" strategy: walk to every reachable action/playerTouch event on
// the current map (BFS on the engine's own passage table with live
// character bodies), trigger it, auto-advance dialogs (choices pick option
// 0), and when the map is exhausted, walk into a static transfer to reach
// the next map. Reports which event pages executed and which never did,
// with a reason.
//
// Coverage is observed through the engine's opt-in `onFiberStart` trace:
// the session fires it once for every page fiber that STARTS — including
// instant fibers (switch/item/gold/...) that begin and end inside one
// stepSession call, which a post-step scan of residual fibers cannot see.
// Every start counts, so a page the explorer re-triggers is counted again.
//
// This is a COVERAGE tool, not a player: it does not solve puzzles, and
// events gated on story state the explorer cannot produce are reported as
// never-triggered with the reason, not as failures.
